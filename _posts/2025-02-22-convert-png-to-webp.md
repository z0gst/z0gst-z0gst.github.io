I am using [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) for screenshots and I have set it up so screenshots are copied directly to the clipboard to allow me to paste them where I need them. The problem I ran into is that the screenshot files are in PNG format, but for documentation, I would prefer them to be in [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) to save some storage space. While there are lots of converters out there, none of them seemed to do what I needed: convert all the PNG files into WebP automatically without having to save them and convert them before using in the MD files. So the easiest solution I came up with is a Python script that scans a markdown file or a directory of markdown files for image references (`![](image.png)`), converts them from PNG to WebP, and replaces the references in the markdown files with the converted files.

Before:

![Markdown image reference before running the script](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-22-convert-png-to-webp/1740203419792.webp) \
![Files in the directory before running the script](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-22-convert-png-to-webp/1740203683457.webp)

After:

![Markdown image reference after running the script](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-22-convert-png-to-webp/1740203518488.webp) \
![Files in the directory after running the script](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-22-convert-png-to-webp/1740203720051.webp)

## Getting started

Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/z0gst/md-img-converter.git
cd md-img-converter
```

Install `python3-venv` if required.

```shell
apt install -y python3-venv
```

Set up a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements for the script.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using the script

> When using the script to convert images for Jekyll post, run the script **after** completing the post and **before** committing and pushing the changes to GitHub.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Set up `Markdown â€º Copy Files: Destination` to use a unique filename to avoid filename conflicts when running the script again after adding additional images to the file. For example, using just `${fileName}` will create another `filename.png` after the first one was converted to `filename.webp`, causing an overwritten image file on a second script run.
{: .prompt-warning }

Once the requirements are installed and the Python virtual environment is active, just run the script.

```shell
python3 converter.py
```

Paste in either a markdown file path or the directory path for multiple markdown files. The easiest way to get the path is to right-click on the file or directory in VS Code and select Copy Path.

![Copy path in VSCode](../assets/img/posts/2025-02-22-convert-png-to-webp/1740203380902.webp)

The script will scan all the PNG image references in the given markdown file(s) and replace them with WebP links after converting the images.

## Deactivate the virtual environment

```shell
deactivate
```
